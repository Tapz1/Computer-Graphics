# Computer-Graphics
CS 330


Upon completing this project, I have taken numerous steps to when I approach software development. I ensure that I comment with purpose, so that I'm not just commenting code for the sake of commenting but instead I comment where it matters to explain the "why" and not the "what". 
I also have learned to test early and often. This simple thought process does wonders. I can't remember how many times that I have gone to build and run the program just to receive an error and when I go back to inspect what it could be, I have already made numerous changes to numerous amounts of code and therefore it becomes difficult and a waste of time figuring what change caused the error. 
These tactics will prove to be invaluable to me as I continue to pursue  a career in software engineering because these are tactics that can be applied anywhere. 

When it comes to my approach in designing software, I have learned to break down real objects that I want to design into smaller shapes. For example, I was stuck when it came to designing a cylinder shape. But, when it came down to it, a cylinder/rounded object can be made with a collection of rotated triangles. 

This computational graphics and visualization course will help me reach my goals through the sheer tenacity that was required to not give up. It was one of the most difficult courses I have had because it required me to think more about translating pure thought and imagination into something more real and tangible. And now that I know the process of how to do so, there isn't anything that I can't bring to life through software.
